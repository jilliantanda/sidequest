# IRL side quests

# Description 
  IRL side quests is a web application using embedded javascript that allows user to track items on their bucket list. User has the ability to create, edit,   delete, and view all items on their list. All items are displayed on the quest log and user has the ability to view more details for each item.

# Approach taken
